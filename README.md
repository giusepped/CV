# CV

Giuseppe De Santis
---------------------------
Junior web developer. I used to work as a technical support engineer for a voice recognition software company. The main part I enjoyed, however, was to figure out new and better ways to go around issues. Thatâ€™s one of the factors that moved me into developing, being able to imagine creative and efficient solutions for problems and make them happen. I am now looking for a position where I can learn more and work on something meaningful in the meantime.


Skills
--------
# Learner
Through the biology courses I did, I got into programming first through Python to solve simple bioinformatics problems and I decided to attend two Open Online Courses from the University of Helsinki in Object Oriented Programming in Java ( https://github.com/giusepped/oo-programming-java-part-I-Helsinki https://github.com/giusepped/oo-programming-java-part-II-Helsinki) that are equivalent to the first two semesters of their Computer Science Curriculum. I also enjoy coding for fun and spend some of my time on codewars to find new, stimulating mini challenges:

# Builder and maker
At Makers Academy I built actual projects from to start to end using several languages and frameworks, including Ruby, Javascript, JQuery, AngularJS, Sinatra, Rails, Node & Express, Socket.io, Html5 Canvas, and I am still eager to learn more. Here are some examples:

Ruby on Rails with ActiveRecord: built a simple web version of Instagram. https://github.com/giusepped/instagram-challenge 
Node/Angular.js web application: a collaborative drawing application where users can sign in and contribute to an html canvas of their choosing or create a new one. The collaboration is simultaneous and that is achieved using socket.io which integrates well with node.js and express. The database we used was Parse. https://github.com/giusepped/vary-pixel/tree/master
